# Variables

The main questions is about the difference between `=` and `:=`. So, the answer can be defined such below:

- [x] `=` is used to assign value to a variable, so can be used when this is created or when it's creation defining type and name using `var` keyword.
- [x] `:=` is a shorthand used to declare and assign a value to variable. Because this, for example, when use this same symbol, in same variable twice, one below other, program will result in error.
